# Cortex Analyzer & Responder Requirements Guide
Analyzers and Responders are autonomous applications managed by and run through the Cortex core
engine. Analyzers allow analysts and security researchers to analyze
observables and IOCs such as
domain names, IP addresses, hashes, files, URLs at scale. While many
analyzers are free to use, some require special access while others
necessitate a valid service subscription or product license, even though the
analyzers themselves are released under an the [AGPL](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex-analyzers/blob/master/LICENSE)
(Affero General Public License).

Responders are programs that perform different actions and apply to alerts, cases, tasks, task logs, and observables.

This document outlines the information needed to:

- install the Cortex analyzers and responders.
- update them when needed.
- configure them.

This documents also specifies whether the service that the analyzer is based
on is free or requires special access or valid subscription or product license.

greatly from using it in conjunction to Cortex and TheHive as these 3
products make an interesting Threat Intelligence, Incident Response and
Digital Forensics ecosystem.

The analyzer comes in only one flavor.

#### Requirements
The MISP analyzer requires you to have access to one or several [MISP](http://www.misp-project.org/)
 instances. You can also deploy your own instance.

Four parameters are required to make the analyzer work:
- `url`
- `key`
- `certpath`
- `name`

You need the URL for each MISP instance you'd like to search. Those URLs go
in the `url` dict. You'll also need the authentication key associated with
your account on each of those instances. To obtain the key, log into the MISP
 instance's Web UI, click on your username on the top navigation bar and
 retrieve the value of the `Authkey` parameter. Each `Authkey` must be added,
  in the same order as the URLs to the `key` dict.

Another important parameter is the `certpath` dict. For each MISP instance:

- Use `false` if you don't want to validate the instance's X.509 certificate or
if the instance use old plain HTTP.
- Use `"/etc/ssl/certs"` or another file to validate the instance's X.509
certificate.

Last but not least, give each instance a name and add it in the order you
specified URLs and keys above to the `name` dict.

**Warning**: using this analyzer without **extra caution** might lead to unexpected consequences. For example, if the URL you are seeking to unshorten is an attacker-controlled one, you may end up leaving undesired traces in the threat actor's infrastructure logs. The TLP values Cortex allows you to configure to prevent the use of an analyzer if the TLP associated with an observable is above the authorized level won't be of much help since Unshortenlink have to access the shortened URL. Please do not activate this analyzer unless you (and your fellow analysts) know what they are doing.

download them using a cron entry or a similar system.

Indicate the path where you have downloaded the hash lists using the `path`
parameter.

### WOT
Check a domain against [Web of Trust](https://www.mywot.com/), a website
reputation service.

This analyzer comes in only one flavor called *WOT_Lookup*.

#### Requirements
An account with Web of Trust is required to get an API key, which is
